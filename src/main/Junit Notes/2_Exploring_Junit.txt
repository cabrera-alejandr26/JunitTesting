TestCase + TestSuite + BaseTestRunner = TestResult.

These three classes are the backbone of the JUnit framework. Once you understand how
TestCase, TestSuite, and BaseTestRunner work, you will be able to write whatever tests
you need. On a daily basis, you only need to write test cases. The other classes work
behind the scenes to bring your tests to life. These three classes work closely with
four other classes to create the core JUnit framework

THE SEVEN CORE JUNIT CLASSES AND INTERFACES:
Class/Interface:

Assert: An assert method is silent when its proposition succeeds but throws an exception
it the proposition fails.

TestResult: A TestResult collects any errors or failures that occur during a test.

Test: A test can be run and passed a TestResult.

TestListener: A TestListener is apprised of events that occur during a test, including
when the test begins and ends, along with any errors or failures.

TestCase: A TestCase defines an environment (or Fixture) that can be used to run multiple tests.

TestSuite: A TestSuite runs a collection of test cases, which may include other test suites. It is a composite
of Tests.

BaseTestRunner: A test runner is a user interface for launching tests. BaseTestRunner
is the superclass for all test runners.
